Is the idea of attaining a humanity that reflects the very best in us --- the absence of war, emphasis on
consciousness elevation, and the shared wealth birthed by a passion for, and exploration of, life and its
living --- not only impractical, but ill-conceived? That by virtue of the necessity of the coercion required
to attain the pinnacle of civilisation, what we must lose to get there would forever tarnish that which came
after.

What if the change were an organic and gradual metamorphosis: from one shape of life, into another? Is this
palatable? Or is the deliberate shaping of minds  in this direction completely unjustified. How is education
best dispensed? In classrooms as they currently are --- en mass with an identical curriculum for all
students? Is the idea of personally driven education by means of students pursuing topics as-interested  to
the level and in the time-fashion that matches their passion, a justifiable one?

What is the purpose of education? In the above example we would see great divergences in the educated
experience and overall suitability for becoming a cog in the capitalist machine.
