description: Brief Questions Regarding Education and Society 
---
Is the idea of attaining a humanity that reflects the very best in us — the absence of war, emphasis on consciousness elevation, and the shared wealth birthed by a passion for, and exploration of, life and its living — not only impractical, but ill-conceived? That the coercion required to attain the pinnacle of civilisation, would forever tarnish that which came after.

What if the change were an organic and gradual metamorphosis: from one shape of life, into another? Is this palatable? Or is the deliberate shaping of minds in this direction completely unjustified. How is education best dispensed? In classrooms as they currently are --- en mass with an identical curriculum for all students? Is the idea of personally driven education by means of students pursuing topics as-interested to the level and in the timeframe that matches their passion, a justifiable one?

What is the purpose of education? In the above example we would see great divergences in the educated experience and overall suitability for becoming a cog in the capitalist machine. Is it for self fulfillment (and) or integration into a larger system?
