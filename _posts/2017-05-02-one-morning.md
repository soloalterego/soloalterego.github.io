>She basks in the sun
Planning the mischief to come
Grinning and carefree

I am told how she and her friend (imaginary) are off to school, to learn words. And when not at school she has to go to work. I can hear her busily talking while she plays --- bouncing on her trampoline, talking, climbing down, and running around. Coming back to inform me of what she is doing. Picking up one of the dog's toys, she hurls it, before running to the little yellow chair that is her gateway to the Dominion of Bounce.
